\section{Interpretazione dei risultati}
%Most machine learning systems operate in batch mode. They analyze a set of
%historical data and then develop a model that reflects the world as it was
%when the model was formed. But the world is dynamic, and the complex
%distributions that a model models are likely to be non-stationary and thus to
%change over time, leading to deteriorating model performance.
